<h1>Hello there, I'm Ruan Emanuell 👋 </h1>

I'm a Fullstack developer with experience in mobile, web, and desktop development. Specializing in Flutter and JavaScript, I'm expanding my horizons into the backend territory with NodeJS and Express JS, while also delving into the world of ReactJS. 🚀

Professionally, I have the most experience with desktop development, but I've also gained a lot of experience with projects of my own independent projects, along with projects with collaboration of other developers! 💻

Oh, and did I mention my mobile projects? 📱 I have a track record of crafting and launching mobile apps that you can find right on the Play Store. From ideation to implementation, I thrive on turning concepts into tangible, user-friendly experiences.

But that's not all—I'm not just about code; I'm also exploring the exciting realms of freelance development and content creation. Embracing the gig economy, I'm open to freelance opportunities, ready to bring my skills to diverse projects. 🌐

In the realm of content creation, I love sharing my insights, experiences, and coding journey. Whether it's through blog posts, videos, or engaging on social media, I'm here to contribute and learn. Let's connect, collaborate, and create something amazing together! 🌟

I was, I am, and I always will be passionate about programming, and I'm looking forward to becoming an even better developer 😊
